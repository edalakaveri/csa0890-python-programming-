# Given sentences
s1 = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
s2 = "the quick blue fox jumps over the lazy cat"

# Split sentences into words
words1 = s1.split()
words2 = s2.split()

# Identify common words
common_words = set(words1) & set(words2)

# Remove common words from both sentences
filtered_words1 = [word for word in words1 if word not in common_words]
filtered_words2 = [word for word in words2 if word not in common_words]

# Join the remaining words back into sentences
result1 = ' '.join(filtered_words1)
result2 = ' '.join(filtered_words2)

# Print the results
print("Resultant Sentence 1:", result1)
print("Resultant Sentence 2:", result2)
